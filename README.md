This project takes the Atwood Machine problem that physics students encounter during Classical Mechanics and generates random yet realistic numbers. This can be useful for instructors, allowing them to quickly and easily generate the numbers for new homework problems to assign their students.
The repository contains two versions of the code. The first version, RAMachine_FinalVersion.py, is just the code itself. This version is intended for users wanting to improve upon or incorporate the code into their own projects, as it doesn't call the function within itself. In essence, the code is only the function. The second version, RAMachine_FinalVersion_Example.py, shows how a user might use the function to generate the Atwood Machine numbers, print out the generated numbers, and even how they might pull the numbers from the returned dictionaries to assign them to variables to use in additional code. This version is intended for users who want only to generate the numbers and/or to provide an example for users on how they might start incorporating the code into their own projects.
